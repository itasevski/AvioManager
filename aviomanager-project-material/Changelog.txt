1. Changed Person entity primary key to be id, not SSN.
2. Removed Flight ID value object from the Flight-Management bounded context. There is no need to store such a
value object since that bounded context contains all the flights.
3. Added FlightDate value object in the Flight-Management bounded context. 
It is used for flights' departure and arrival dates.
4. Renamed flight state to flight status.
